    title: Rough Prototyping
    body: >
      As this demo was put together as a rough proof-of-concept for a Startup
      Weekend prototype, rather than using the specialized 360-degree camera we
      use for all our current shoots, we had to assemble it with whatever
      equipment we already had on hand. These panoramas were assembled, shot by
      shot, using the Photo Sphere function of the stock Android camera app.
      Although this yields a largely serviceable capture of a room's
      appearance, its moment-to-moment and positional-sensor-reliant nature
      did lead to some errors - such as these repeated corners and vanishing
      faces.

    title: Hole in the World
    body: >
      This completely-black gap in this panorama is probably the worst artifact
      of our early phone-based capture experiment. Although we did have another
      panorama of this room without a blacked-out region, the angle it was
      taken from hid most of the room's details - so, the decision was made to
      stick with the reshoot from a more interesting position, in spite of its
      stitching-based flaws.
